# Description
JUnit 4 might be considered the standard testing framework in Java, but since its release in 2006 not much has changed, as the framework neglected to provide ways to simplify testing or make it more flexible. Luckily, in 2017, a developer-friendly upgrade - JUnit 5 - was released with its main goals being to be both backwards and forwards compatible. JUnit 5 features include parallel and conditional test execution, tagging, nested tests, dynamic tests, repeated tests, parametrized tests, custom display names and more. Furthermore, with the new JUnit Platform, third-party test engines can be developed for other JVM languages. This presentation walks the audience through the JUnit 5 architecture, highlights the advantages over its predecessor, and covers the way to migrate from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.
